## About
This project was created as a way for me to learn more about software development and to establish my name as a developer. This repository includes a backend and every API (end point) that a front-end component will need to use. It is a fully REST API built in node js that connects and serves user queries, blogs, comments, and user management with full Token based (JWT) authentication and authorization.
## Usage

- It is integratable with any front-end component that consume a REST API.

### Branches

 I use an agile continuous integration methodology, so the version is frequently updated and development is really fast.

1. **`develop`** is the development branch.

2. **`master`** is the production branch.

3. No other permanent branches should be created in the main repository, you can create feature branches but they should get merged with the master.

**Steps to work with feature branch**

1. To start working on a new feature, create a new branch prefixed with `feat` and followed by feature name. (ie. `feat-FEATURE-NAME`)
2. Once you are done with your changes, you can raise PR.

**Steps to create a pull request**

1. Make a PR to `stage` branch.
2. Comply with the best practices and guidelines e.g. where the PR concerns visual elements it should have an image showing the effect.
3. It must pass all continuous integration checks and get positive reviews.

After this, changes will be merged.


### Guideline
- write clear code
